Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(*n*) complexity.

**Example:**

```
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
